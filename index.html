        <h3 class="ab">ABOUT</h3>
        <p class="ba">
            YC Continuity is an investment fund dedicated to supporting founders as they scale their companies. Our primary goal is to support YC alumni companies by investing in their subsequent funding rounds, though we occasionally invest in non-YC companies as well.
        </p>
        <p class="ba">
            Like YC’s early-stage partners, the entire YC Continuity team has strong operating experience. We work to create opportunities for founders to continue their personal growth and scale their companies successfully.
        </p>
        <p class="ba">
            We also run the <a href="#">YC Growth Program,</a> which brings together founder-CEOs who are leading rapidly growing companies.
        </p><br>
        <h3 class="ab">HOW WE INVEST</h3>
        <p class="ba">
            We invest in companies that show strong product-market fit, generally in Series B or later rounds. Our investments range between $20–100M in size. We have both led rounds and participated as co-investors in rounds led by others. We do not have strict valuation parameters, but look for companies with clear business models and customer traction.
